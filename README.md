# M185 Middle Button (Scroll Wheel Button) Fix

I have one of these Logitech mice and it has been quite a good mouse.

Unfortunately recnetly the middle button stopped working.

As reported elsewhere, this is a known issue.

I found [this reported fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/17fjdf1/fix_for_erratic_middle_click_behavior_on_m185_mice/) which had the right idea.

I found an even simpler fix with less chance of breaking the mouse.

## Safe fix

1. Open the battery compartment.
2. Remove the battery.
3. Unscrew the single screw.
4. Pry open the mouse, carefully so as not to break the plastic snap-in.
5. Observe the scroll wheel button switch is a piece of plastic mounted in a pivoting cradle on top of a regular button.
6. Lift the scroll wheel edge slightly so there is a gap between it and the button.
7. Cut a small piece of electrical tape large enough to cover the button, lift the scroll wheel again, and stick it to the button.
8. If you are worried about it moving, create a 'fence' out of tape around the button area to stop it coming off.

## Result

 * Correct functionality restored
 * No chance of mucking up your mouse mechanism with glue
 * Easy reversion to prior state

## Closing comments

Probably a 3D printed shield would be possible, but why bother? I'm sure this fix will see out the life of the mouse.
